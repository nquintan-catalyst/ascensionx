        <h1>About Polygon</h1>
        <p>
          The $ASCN token is hosted on the Polygon network, which provides
          several key benefits for the development of the Ascension Ecoverse
          project. With plasma chain capabilities for in-game transactions
          alongside speed, security, and low gas fees, the Polygon network is
          the perfect home for the $ASCN token and Ascension Ecoverse game.

        <h2>Start On Your Island!</h2>
        <p>
          Your Ascension Ecoverse journey starts on the Ascension Island NFT
          that you will call home. These islands contain all the resources and
          systems that you need to kickstart your journey, and if you’re lucky,
          some might even come with special traits that give you an in-game
          boost! Learn more about islands below.

        <h2>Harvest, Craft, and Sell Your Way to Success!</h2>
        <p>
          Every resource on your island can be harvested, and either crafted
          into items, or sold! Harvest your resources and craft them into items
          for faster production, then sell off your produce to the Vendor for
          profits! Each resource takes time to harvest, and every crafted item
          has an associated cost, so it's up to you to determine the strategy
          that makes you the most profit!{" "}

        <h2>Watch and Mitigate the World Pollution Bar!</h2>
        <p>
          Just like in real life, every action you take has repercussions, and
          these repercussions are reflected on the World Pollution Bar (WPB).
          Climate-friendly actions will lower the WPB, while unsustainable
          actions will raise the WPB, keeping environmentalism at the top of
          players' minds at all times. Just remember, as the WPB rises, the
          entire Ecoverse will be completely reshaped! Storms, rising water
          levels, temperature changes, and other environmental disasters will
          make it harder and harder to harvest the resources you need to
          survive.{" "}
